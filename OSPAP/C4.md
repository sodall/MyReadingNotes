# C4 Concurrency and Threads
- concurrency: multiple acitivies that can happen at the same time
- thread: a single execution sequence that represents a separately schedulable task

## Thread advantages
- program structure
  - expressing logically concurrent tasks
- responsiveness
  - shifting work to run in the background
- performance
  - exploiting multiple processors
  - manageing I/O devices

## Thread abstraction
- thread scheduler: switch between running threads and ready threads
- execution model: each thread runs on a dedicated virtual processor with unpredictable and variable speed
- cooperative threads (out-dated)
- preemptive multithreading

## Simple thread API
- asynchronous procedure call
- fork-join parallelism
  - fork/thread_create
  - wait/join

## Thread data structures
- thread control block (TCB):
  - state of the computation being performed
    - thread stack pointer
    - copy of processor registers
  - metadata: for managing the thread
-  shared state
  - program code
  - global variables
  - heap variable
- thread local variables
  - errno
  - heap internals

## Thread life cycle state
- INIT: allocates and initialize per-thread data structures (TCB) 
- READY: available to run but not running; TCB on ready list
- RUNNING: TCB on running list
- WAITING: TCB on synchronization variable waiting list
- FINISHED: TCB on finished list

## Implementation of kernel threads
### Specifics of implementation
- kernel threads
- kernel threads and single-threaded processes
- multi-threaded processes using kernel threads
- user-level threads

### Creating a thread
1. allocate per-thread state
2. initialize per-thread state
  - stub
  - thread_switch
3. put TCB on ready list

### Deleting a thread
- thread_exit
  - remove the thread from ready list, move to finished list
  - free the per-thread state allocated by the other threads

### Thread context switch
- voluntary: thread_yield; thread_join; thread_exit
  - disable interrupts
  - thread_switch
  - thread_dummySwitchFrame
- involuntary: interrupt; processor exception
  1. save the state
  2. run the kernel handler; no mode switch needed
  3. restore the state
  
### Implementation of multi-threaded processes 
## Multi-threaded process Using kernel threads
- Multi-threaded process thread:
  - a user-level stack
  - a kernel interrupt stack
  - a kernel TCB

## User-level thread
### Without kernel support
- reason: minimize dependencies on specific OS
- preemptive user-level threads
  - signal handler; akin to upcalls

### With kernel support
- hybrid thread join
- per-processor kernel threads
- scheduler activations
  - increasing the number of virtual processors
  - decreasing the nuumber of virtual processors
  - transitions:
    - to waiting
    - from waiting to ready
    - from running to idle
  
## Alternative abstractions
### Asynchronous I/O
- Process: issue an I/O request but return immediately
- OS result notification:
  - calling a signal handler
  - placing the result in a queue in user memory
  - storing in kernel memory until process makes system call

### Event-driven programming 
- for servers
- continuation: task's current state and next step
- event-driven vs. threads
  - I/O performance: event-driven
  - multiple processor performance: threads, often combined
  - responsiveness: threads
  - program structure: equal
  - summary: threads easier

### Data parallel programming
- for multiprocessors
- large data-analysis
- GPU
