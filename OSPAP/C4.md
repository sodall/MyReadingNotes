# C4 Concurrency and Threads
- concurrency: multiple acitivies that can happen at the same time
- thread: a single execution sequence that represents a separately schedulable task

## Thread advantages
- program structure
  - expressing logically concurrent tasks
- responsiveness
  - shifting work to run in the background
- performance
  - exploiting multiple processors
  - manageing I/O devices

## Thread abstraction
- thread scheduler: switch between running threads and ready threads
- execution model: each thread runs on a dedicated virtual processor with unpredictable and variable speed
- cooperative threads (out-dated)
- preemptive multithreading

## Simple thread API
