# C6 Multi-Object Synchronization
## Multiprocessor Lock Performance
1. locking
2. communication of shared data
  - multiprocessor: copy from one cache to another
3. false sharing

## Lock design patterns
- fine-grained locking

| Solution                         	| Pros                        	| Cons             	|
|----------------------------------	|-----------------------------	|------------------	|
| introduce a readers/writers lock 	| simple and high concurrency 	| high overhead    	|
| acquire every lock               	| works when resize is rare   	| resize expensive 	|
| divide the hash key space        	| balance                     	| complex          	|
- per-processor data structures
  - per-processor ready list
    - pros: better hw cache behavior
    - cons: decreased effectiveness of cache
- ownership design pattern
- staged architecture
  - communcation by messages via producer-consumer queue
  - pros: improved modularity and cache locality
  - cons: overload
  - dynamically vary the number of threads per stage

## Lock contention
### MSC(Mellor-Crummey and Scott) locks
- test and test-and-set (not working)
- compare and swap

### RCU(Read-copy update) locks
- improvements to reader/writer locks
  1. restricted update: publish changes by updating a pointer
  2. multiple concurrent versions
  3. integration with the thread scheduler
    - grace period
- API
  - reader:
    - readLock(), readUnlock()
  - writer:
    - writeLock(), writeUnlock()
    - publish()
    - synchronize(): wait for all currently active readers to exit critical section
  - scheduler:
    - quiescentState()
- implementation
  - integration with scheduler:
    1. read-only critical sections complete w/o being interrupted
    2. whever a thread is interrupted, the scheduler updates some per-processor RCU state

## Multi-Object atomicity
- careful class design
- acquire all/release all
  - serializability across requests
- two-phase locking

## Deadlock
