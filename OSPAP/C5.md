# C5 Synchronizing Access to Shared Objects
## Cooperating threads
- program execution depends on the possible interleaving sof threads' access to shared state
- program execution can be nondeterministic
  - heisenbugs
  - bohr bugs
- compilers and processor hw can reorder instructions

## Challenges
- race conditions
- atomic operations
- "too much milk" problem:
  - safety
  - liveness
  - Peterson's algorithm
  - memory barriers

## Structuring shared objects
- shared object layer
  - application-specific logic
- synchronization variable layer
  - locks and condition variables
  - coordinate access to state variables
- atomic instruction layer
  - atomic read-modify-write instructions

## Locks
- states: BUSY or FREE
- lock::acquire(): waits until FREE then set the state to BUSY; atomic
- lock::release(): set to FREE
- properties:
  - mutual exclusion
  - progress
  - bounded waiting
- (thread-safe) bounded queue
- critical section
  - only one thread actively executes any of the critical sections per shared object instance
  - a program can create multiple instances of a class

## Condition variables
- CV::wait(Lock *lock): 
  - atomically releases the lock and suspends execution of the calling thread, put it to waiting list
  - when the thread is re-enabled, it re-aquires the lock before return
- CV::signal(): 
  - takes one off the waiting list and marks it eligible to run
- CV::broadcast(): 
  - takes all of the waiting list and marks them as eligible to run
- properties:
  - a CV is memoryless
  - wait() atomically releases the lock
  - when a waiting thread is re-enabled via signal or broadcast, it may not run immediately
- wait() must be called within a loop
  - simplifying the implementation
  - improving modularity

## Design Shared Objects
### Methodology
1. add a lock
2. add code to acquire and release the lock
3. identify and add condition variables
4.
